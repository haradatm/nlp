0	just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half .
0	everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television .
0	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
0	creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
0	bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad .
0	for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
0	what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
0	[morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism .
0	a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess .
0	unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
0	friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ?
0	i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha .
0	despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
0	the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
0	a tv episode inflated past its natural length .
0	glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
0	a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .
0	winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
0	the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes .
0	if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
0	what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
0	just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
0	rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
0	at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
0	an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
0	got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length .
0	gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
0	i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
0	i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
0	except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
0	a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
0	for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
0	there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
0	i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's .
0	the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down .
0	interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
0	there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right .
0	even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd .
0	with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .
0	mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values .
0	kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
0	a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
0	it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
0	there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters .
0	would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?
0	kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
0	in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
0	observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom .
0	the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice .
0	far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
0	her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
0	fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .
0	director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it .
0	strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short .
0	it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
0	barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
0	writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results .
0	qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .
0	donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
0	blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .
0	tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it .
0	unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .
0	there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .
0	incoherence reigns .
0	a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .
0	the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours .
0	" freaky friday , " it's not .
0	perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
0	in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie .
0	sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor .
0	it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .
0	never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
0	wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award .
0	at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
0	elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this .
0	a preposterous , prurient whodunit .
0	unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
0	alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .
0	much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
0	adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
0	one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
0	the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster .
0	despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
0	the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .
0	there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .
0	schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
0	what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
0	slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
0	rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
0	when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w .
0	content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
0	what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie .
0	mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
0	there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
0	flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up .
0	viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet .
0	writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
0	there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
0	lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .
0	for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
0	impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .
0	a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic .
0	in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
0	aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
0	for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
0	it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
0	a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
0	with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
0	doesn't really add up to much .
0	this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
0	when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
0	tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . "
0	never inspires more than an interested detachment .
0	as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music .
0	despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
0	worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
0	tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .
0	. . . a confusing drudgery .
0	set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york .
0	long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .
0	a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
0	neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
0	i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .
0	all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .
0	humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
0	nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done .
0	muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
0	meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
0	a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .
0	a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .
0	i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them .
0	high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
0	an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
0	i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
0	every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
0	the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut !
0	[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
0	has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital .
0	the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
0	fairly run-of-the-mill .
0	the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
0	it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting .
0	after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
0	each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
0	it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
0	meandering and confusing .
0	there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
0	sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films .
0	the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it .
0	. . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .
0	how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
0	elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
0	fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
0	barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .
0	what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel .
0	has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
0	director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
0	whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
0	feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
0	more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
0	it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows .
0	despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
0	that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies .
0	director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
0	spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
0	the title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
0	an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 .
0	it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything .
0	the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home .
0	grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine .
0	tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club .
0	so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie .
0	when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
0	essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . .
0	a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story .
0	its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
0	the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
0	hollywood's answer to an air ball .
0	yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title .
0	despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . .
0	once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
0	rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
0	a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
0	a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .
0	the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections .
0	what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .
0	sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
0	fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
0	i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
0	if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
0	while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor .
0	perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy .
0	the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
0	a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
0	a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
0	it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf .
0	cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
0	a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent .
0	you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup .
0	a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
0	strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing .
0	its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy .
0	it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
0	none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective .
0	perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going .
0	i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care .
0	the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
0	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
0	a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products .
0	the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
0	certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .
0	the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm .
0	a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
0	woody , what happened ?
0	festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
0	bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
0	rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
0	some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .
0	nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget .
0	it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
0	this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
0	does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
0	does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring .
0	don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy .
0	the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows .
0	a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust .
0	an extraordinarily silly thriller .
0	the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
0	the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .
0	this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie .
0	one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen .
0	a feeble tootsie knockoff .
0	diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
0	a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .
0	eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .
0	debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish .
0	while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier .
0	the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
0	characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
0	the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . "
0	like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
0	for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
1	with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .
1	occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective .
1	if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid .
1	the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .
1	an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career .
1	the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
1	a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than " memento "
1	haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .
1	while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story .
1	on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique .
1	a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
1	it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self .
1	a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences .
1	more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent .
1	must be seen to be believed .
1	this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary !
1	at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers .
1	the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
1	polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics . is this progress ?

1	an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .
1	over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance .
